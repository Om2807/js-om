   javaScript Execution Content

java script is a single threded language

{}-> global Execution
-> global execution context
-> function execetion context
-> Eval Execution context

[{}]=> 2 phases devided
-> memory creation phase(creation phase)
->execetion phase

//to understand put code file:

" let val1 = 10
let val2 = 5
function addnum(num1, num2){
    let total = num1 + num2
    return total
}
let result1 = addnum(val1, val2)
let result2 = addnum(10, 2) "

//steps for execetion of this code file

step 1 -> global execution(allocated in "this")
step 2 -> memory phase(collect all variables ,and put them   
 {
    val1 -> undefined
    val2 -> undefined
    addnum -> definition of whole function
    result1 -> undefined
    result2 -> undefined
 })
 step 3 -> execetion phase
 {
 val1 <- 10
 val2 <- 5
 addnum ->[{new variable environment + execetion thred}]
 result1 = 15
 result2 = (same story as addnum fuction repeatedly)
 }

 //jintni bar function execeut hog utni bar apne ko memory phase or execution phase use karna he.......

 memory phase for "addnum":->
 val1 ->undefined
 val2 ->undefined
 total ->undefined

 //now go execetion context
 num1 -> 10
 num2 -> 5
 total -> 15

 //total value is returned in global execetion context me


 //execution context kaam khatam hone ke baad delete bhi ho jata he

let's you have method like"one()" so when you execeut it 
then first you put in stack   than it will executed,, after execetion it will removed from stack..
